Updated proposal for thesis corrections
=======================================

In order to make the discussion in this document (and in the revised thesis)
clear, we distinguish between a coeffect _language framework_ and concrete
context-aware _domain-specific languages_ (DSLs). The former captures the common
structure of many context-aware programming languages and is used to simplify
the construction of the latter. For example, the coeffect calculus introduced in
Section 4.2 of the submitted thesis is a language framework while a language for
causal data-flow in Section 3.2.4 is a concrete context-aware DSL.

1. Providing uniquely determined semantics
------------------------------------------
The first issue in the thesis is the incoherent semantics (semantics is defined
over a _typing derivation_ and different typing derivations lead to a different
semantics). We argue that this is a natural property of the _language framework_,
which must support multiple different ways in which context is propagated in
concrete context-aware DSLs. However, a concrete context-aware DSL should have a
coherent semantics. For a given program (written in a given DSL), we intend to
choose a _unique typing derivation_. The unique typing derivation then determines
the (unique and coherent) semantics of the program. 

This will be done formally so that the resulting typing derivation is provably
unique. The concrete solution in the revised thesis will be either an algorithm
or a syntax driven algorithmic type system. The choice of the typing derivation
will be practically justified, which also lets us explore the choices made by
existing languages (such as Haskell’s implicit parameters) as well as their
interesting alternatives.

2. Categorically guided definition of DSLs
------------------------------------------
The categorical semantics already presented in the thesis (Sections 4.3 and 5.3)
will be viewed as a _language framework_ for deriving _safe domain-specific
languages_ with a categorical semantics that guides the implementation of the
DSL. We clarify that the categorical semantics is not used to prove properties
of the system, but merely to guide the design of the concrete DSLs. 

The language framework defines a unified type system that can be instantiated to
obtain a type system for a concrete context-aware DSL. For a given DSL, the type
system prevents certain kinds of errors related to working with context. We will
include a formal proof showing what errors are ruled out by the type system for
at least 2 concrete coeffect DSLs (discussed in details in Section 4 below).

3. Language framework implementation
------------------------------------
As an additional justification for the usefulness of coeffect systems as
language frameworks for building safe domain-specific languages, we intend to
provide an implementation that transforms code written in a particular DSL
(source language with coeffect support) into an existing target programming
language. The translation will provide a concrete implementation of the
categorical seman¬tics mentioned above (in a similar way in which the
Haskell’s 'do' notation uses the monadic structure).

The translation will be demonstrated using at least two of the concrete systems
discussed in the thesis (implicit parameters, liveness or data-flow) and we will
provide a range of concrete example programs that use the domain specific
languages (and demonstrate the usefulness of the coeffect abstraction). 

4. Proof outline for type soundness of concrete DSLs
----------------------------------------------------
The key new results that will be presented in the revised thesis are proofs
illuminating the safety guarantees that the coeffect type system of the language
framework provides for concrete context-aware DSLs. We intend to provide proof
for at least two of the DSLs and give an informal sketch how our proof technique
can be generalized to work with any system.

The categorical semantics describes a translation from a source context-aware
DSL to a target functional language. We intend to show that for a well-typed
program written in the DSL, the translated program can be evaluated in the
target language without errors. This will be done by proving the progress and
preservation theorems for target language programs that are obtained by the
translation.

Using the causal data-flow language as a concrete example, we will:

 - Formally define the target language (simply-typed lambda calculus with lists)
   and its operational semantics (using the standard small-step reduction  
   relation); the language will include exceptions that are produced when a head
   or tail of an empty list is accessed.
    
 - Define the translation from source DSL into the target language, following the
   structure of the categorical semantics; the lists in the target language will 
   be used to represent past values; the `prev` construct and variable access will
   operate on the lists.
   
 - The coeffect type system for data-flow determines the maximal number of past
   values required by a program. We show that reducing a program obtained from the
   source DSL with input that has sufficient number of past values does not produce
   an exception.
   
The above will be done concretely for two context-aware DSLs and we will also
sketch an informal argument showing how the proof would generalize to other DSLs
(relying on the abstraction mechanism provided by the type system of Haskell and
similar languages).
